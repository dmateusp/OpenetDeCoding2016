# OpenetDeCoding2016
This is my completed solution to the Openet De/Coding contest 2016.

I was not able to submit a complete solution on the day of the contest so please do not assume my solution is "perfect", I will appreciate any comments or remarks at dmateusp@gmail.com .


RULES : The competition time limit was 2 hours, the solution could be coded in C++ or Java, we had access to the official documentations only ! Only original code could be used not even code from your own projects could be used (or looked at) 

If you are training for next year's competition, I wish you good luck !
